# Website-Analysis-Python
This is a project in which I attempt to apply the concepts learned from my CS 350 course at ODU.

Why have I decided to tackle this project?

I believe that completing this project on my own, under the guidance of Prof. Kennedy, would be immensely helpful to hone and develop my software development skills. I am also attempting to solely use the terminal/command line for this project rather than being aided by my favorite git GUI, sourcetree, thus finally using and learning the git commands needed by all developers. Throughout this project I plan on becoming more comfortable with developing in Linux (specifically Ubuntu) as it will be the main system I will be using.


Current Plans:

    • Redo the semester project in Python3 with Beautiful Soup
    • Main effort will be focused around Test Driven Development, Documentation, ADTs, etc.
